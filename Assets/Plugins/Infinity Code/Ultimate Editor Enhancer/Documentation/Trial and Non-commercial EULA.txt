If you are using a trial version of an asset, it is distributed based on Unity Asset Store EULA during the trial period and is commercially usable:

After the end of the trial period, the asset automatically switches to the non-commercial version, and if you use the asset in a commercial project, you must purchase the asset in Unity Asset Store, or remove it from your project.

You can use the non-commercial version of an asset in a project in the following cases:
- In the project for personal non-commercial purposes;
- In an open source project;
- When creating video content for public video services (such as YouTube, Vimeo, etc.), regardless of the presence of monetization on your channel;
- In a project created for the purposes of education or medicine.

In any other case, you must buy the asset from Unity Asset Store, start a trial period, or remove the asset from the project.
